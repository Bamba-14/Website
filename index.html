        		<p>Bodyframe (besides being the name of the game suggestion) is a company founded in 2024 with a mission to predict the future. Soon after they started working on their prediction model they realised that they have to go back to the past in order to manipulate the future by changing the events of the past. By the end of 2038 they've sucesfully finished their prototype to virtually travel to the past or future. This could be done by a special suit and goggles which provided the physical feel for the person "traveling" as well as mimicing their gestures and expressions. A microchip inserted in the body would provide the person with the necessery storage as well as planting the necessary skills and knowladge. Combine that with the injection of frameX, a special body liquid developed to intoxicate the person, not just mentaly but also physically. This would leave the person recovering, not being able to move for days after they "traveled", depending on the amount of time they spent in the past/future as well as the time difference of the destination. The recovery time would be spend in a bath of milk, vinegar and a lot of salt, which help to recover the cells destroyed by the frameX.</p>

        		<p>The development of the game started in june 2020, with a steep learning curve ahead. In this time a lot of features have been developed and the family/friends updates were frequent. The project has entered the stage, where a new platform to supply updates to anyone interested was needed. The updates here will continue from version 0.1 as I've internally named it. You will also be able to see what is planned in the future and embark on the journey of creating with me. A lot of unknown is ahead of us, but I'm sure it will be a lot of fun.</p>
