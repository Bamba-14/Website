            		<p>Currently named BodyFrame is a game full of exploration, interesting mechanics and interactions, all avaliable in a beautiful pixel art world. Atleast that's how I see it, hopefully you do too. Another big part of the game is the story, which is engaging with a lot of plot twists, where your actions and decisios influence the way it plays. Well that's the plan anyway, for now I've finished version 0.1 as I've internaly decided.</p>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>Good news! There is already a lot of mechanics done in the game. Those range from different attacks and weapons, interactions with AI, there is ofcourse AI brain involved, they can walk! (and much more). Some of the graphics are already my own, some are obviously placeholders, but fear not, I'll make them all!</p>

            		<p>I don't want to reveal that. But I can tell you the story of how I've started making the game. I've always enjoyed playing games and I've always admired those who can code. So it only makes sense. I've mayored in something else, but I'm employed as a software developer. Unfortunaly I'm working in ancient language, but it helped me undarstand the logic behind programming.</p>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>Well since I've wanted to do it, I did it. I started learning Unity in June 2020. After a couple of small projects, both in 3D I've decided to make a 2D game as it seems more realistic of a project for a single person. Specially since I want to create the art by my self. The begining was confusing, but it flew by. Now I understand it much better and my pixel art has taken a giant leap, hopefully for the better. I still have a lot to learn but I'm looking forward to doing so and I hope you'll join me reaching my goal.</p>

                            <h2>Farmer</h2>
                            <p>He's my first NPC and has replaced the placeholder guy I had before. He's more advanced not just by the way he looks and moves, but he also has an animation for when he's working on his field. Does anyone have a name suggestion?</p>

                            <h2>Enemy</h2>
                            <p>his is the first enemy I've created. To be honest I was very motivated as I got extremly depressed of watching the same boring placeholder kicking my ass. I mean he didn't even have an attack animation, yet I still died. So I've created this amazing bad-ass with a big mace, to feel better about myself when I die to an enemy in my own game.</p>

                    <p>Uhh I don't know. If you're a friend or family there is a great chance you've already played. If not, then visit this website sometimes, to see how the game development is going. If you're really interested in the game and want to play it, please send me an email, I check those every now and then.</p>
