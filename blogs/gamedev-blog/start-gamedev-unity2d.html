                <h5>13. jan. 2021</h5>
                <p>The tutorial is written in a step by step process. If you're familiar with Unity or you're only interested in the code part, <b>you can skip to the end where you can find the snippet of entire code.</b></p>
                <p>As we've discussed in the previous post, Unity is a very popular and capable game engine. In order to use it you have to download it first on there website, you can do that <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download"target="_blank">here</a>. Select the correct version for your PC and follow the instalation process (it's very easy and similar to any software install)</p>
                <br>
                <h2>How to start a project</h2>
                <p>After you start Unity Hub, simply click on "new" and select the type of project you wish to create. We'll start with a 2D project since it's a bit simpler if you're a solo developer and completly new to game development. If you'd like to start a 3D project you can select that here. Then name your project and select where you want it to be saved. After that, click "create" and wait a bit for the project to load.</p>
                <h2>Quick overview of the interface</h2>
                <p>1) Tools to manipulate game objects - move them, resize and rotate them etc.</p>
                <p>2) A menu of all game objects in your current scene, here is also the place to create new ones.</p>
                <p>3) Menus for animation and grid manipulation (drawing, erasing etc).</p>
                <p>4) Project folder, where you can create scripts, prefabs, scenes, materials and organise them in folders.</p>
                <p>5) Game object settings, you can add components and then set them to the values you want.</p>
                <p>Don't worry, the interface will feel more familiar as soon as you start with some examples.</p>

                <h2>Creating a player</h2>
                <p>The first thing you need in order to create a player is a game object. In the Hierarchy area, right click and select "Create empty". Now you can name it "Player", so you'll always know which game object is the Player game object. Then go to the "Inspector" on the right and for the tag select "Player". You will soon find out why this is usefull.</p>
                <p>Right now you still can't see the player, so let's change that. In the "Inspector" click add component and in the search area type "Sprite Renderer" and confirm it. This component allows us to use an image to represent the game object. If you have your own art you can use that, if not you can download my art <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12BuzuW9ICOcpQmANkoqs6ppiOt9SWfI0?usp=sharing"target="_blank">here</a>. Now let's go to the "Project" area and let's right click and create a new folder, name it "Art". Then simply drag the art into Unity in the Art folder. Now click on the "tutorial-player-walk" image you've just imported and in the inspector select:</p>
                <p>Sprite mode: Multiple</p>
                <p>Pixels per Unity: 16</p>
                <p>Filter mode: Point (no filter)</p>
                <p>Compression: None</p>
                </p>Then click "Apply" and after it's done click on the "Sprite Editor". Now select slice, grid by cell size and enter 16x32 - that's correct for the pixel art you've downloaded in this post, if you have different art, slice it based in the way it was created. Then click "Finish" and we're done with importing art for our player. Now let's once again click on the Player game object and select the little knob in the Sprite Renderer component (Sprite section) in the "Inspector". Now select a sprite, I ussualy just go with a front facing character, don't worry we'll add animations later and it won't be important.</p>
                <img class="imagePixelArt" src="./images/blog/GettingStartedWithUnityToolbox.png" alt="Toolbox Pixel Art">
                <p>The next thing we want to do is add more components to the Player game object, so we can make him move and interact with the game world. Let's add components (same way we did the Sprite Renderer), "BoxCollider2D" and "RigidBody2D". The "RigidBody2D" component will be used to move our character and the "BoxCollider2D" component will be used for our character to interact with the game world. For our example we'll use a 4-way directional movement, which is used in top-down games. In order to the that you should go to the inspector area and inside the "RigidBody2D" component set "Gravity Scale" to 0. This way gravity won't pull out player down. If you want for example a platformer, you can use gravity since you have 2-way directional movement with jumps for going up and gravity to pull you back down.</p>
                <p>Now it's time for us to create our first script! Let's head to the project area and the same way we've created and Art folder before, we now create a "Scripts" folder. I ussualy create another folder called "Player" and put all of the player scripts in here, just to keep things organised. Then inside the folder right click and create a new C# script, you can name it "PlayerMovement". Open the script. There are two methods already created, a Start method and an Update method. A start method is excuted only once and that's at the start when the game object becomes active. The Update method is started after the Start method and is being continously exectued. There are a lot of other methods, which all function differently and can be used in different scenarios. We'll learn two other methods in this tutorial post.</p>
                <p>The first is a method called "Awake". It's similar to the start method but it's executed before the Start method. I like using the Awake method when I'm setting variables, getting components and other similar tasks. However, before the methods let's create variables, one will be a float called "speed" and the other one will be named "playerRigidbody", which will allow us manipulate the RigidBody2D inside our code. Variables can be "private" or "public" (same with methods or voids). If it's private it means it can only be used in this script and it also won't be visible in the inspector. If it's public it can be referenced and used in other methods/voids and it will be visible in the Inspector. For speed we can set it to private and set the variable to [SerializeField]. This setting makes the variable visible in the Unity Inspector.</p>
                <div class="codeSnippets">
                    <pre>
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField]
    private float speed;

    private Rigidbody2D playerRigidBody;
    private Vector3 moveDirection;</pre>
                </div>
                <p>After the variables are completed, let's create the Awake method and assign the RigidBody2D component.</p>
                <div class="codeSnippets">
                    <pre>
    private void Awake()
    {
        playerRigidBody = GetComponent&ltRigidbody2D&gt();
    }</pre>
                </div>
                <p>Now that our code can access the Rigidbody2D component of out Player game object, we want to add velocity to the component. For that we're goind to use the "FixedUpdate" method. The difference between the Fixed update method and the Update method is that the Update method runs once per frame, while the Fixed update can run zero times, once or many times per frame. That's because it takes your frame rate into consideration. Now that we're assignig velocity to a game object it's better to do it in a Fixed update so that player with lower FPS won't have slower moving characters compared to player with a highier FPS.</p>
                <p>To apply velocity to the Ridigdbody we'll use a Vector3 and and moveDirection variable we've set and multiply the X axis and Y axis value with speed. We don't have to worry about the Z axis as we're in a 2D space.</p>
                <div class="codeSnippets">
                    <pre>
    private void FixedUpdate()
    {
        playerRigidBody.velocity = new Vector3(moveDirection.x * speed, moveDirection.y * speed);
    }</pre>
                </div>
                <p>The last thing we need to do is get players input in our script. This part we can do in the Update method as the things we've talked about before don't apply here. For that we'll make two variables a moveX and a moveY which will recieve the players input. We are using Unitys Input manager for this, where the axis input is set to "WASD" or arrow keys when using a keyboard. You can change the bidings here if you'd like something else.</p>
                <img class="imagePixelArt" src="./images/blog/GettingStartedWithUnityCalendar.png" alt="Simple calendar Pixel Art">
                <p>When we get the input we just have to set the moveDirection variable to the correct Vector3 using the moveX and moveY and at the end we're going to add ".normalize" to make sure the player doesn't move faster when going diagonally.</p>
                <div class="codeSnippets">
                    <pre>
    void Update()
    {
        float moveX = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");
        float moveY = Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");

        moveDirection = new Vector3(moveX, moveY, 0f).normalized;
    }</pre>
                </div>
