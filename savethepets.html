                <div class="main">
                    <p><b>When and how can you play?</b></p>
                    <p>The game is releasing on Android and iOS sometime towards the end of 2022. After the release it will receive updates - fixes and content.</p>
                    <p><b>What is the game about?</b></p>
                    <p>There's a bit of a story element to the game with your goal being saving as many pets as you can. The gameplay is easy to master and the challenges are never ending. It's the perfect game if you're waiting for an appointment, need to relax or you know... taking a number two.</p>
                    <p><b>Why NO ADS?</b></p>
                    <p>Noone likes ads and they don't belong in games - that's my opinion. I'll be estatic if people can enjoy my game and the best way to do it is ad free. If you'd like to support me besides being awesome and playing my game - a review will go a long way and there's a store where you can purchase cosmetics. I'm working hard on making them look and feel awesome so hopefully they're worth it. (Hopefully this makes it into the game)</p>
                    <p><b>My first published game</b></p>
                    <p>I'm working on a couple of games that I'm planing to release on PC, but this is my first finished product. That's why I would appreciate any feedback and you can always support me by taking a look at my social media <b>(socials are bellow).</b> </p>
                </div>
                <div class="main">
                    <p><b>A march through history</b></p>
                    <p>If you can't wait that long to play it, you can play the browser version bellow. <b>Keep in mind that this is a year and a half old version and does not reflect the current game.</b> If you're interested in the progress of the mobile version follow me on Twitter or join the Discord Server. <b>(socials are bellow).</b></p>
                    <p><b>Goal of the game:</b></p>
                    <p>The squares represent the animals lost in the wilderness.The number tells you how many treats the animals need to return to you and the color changes the closer you get to regaining the pets trust. Save as many animals as you can!</p>
                    <p><b>How the game works:</b></p>
                    <p>At the bottom of the game screen, you can see the amount of pets you've saved as well as the amount of treats you've already fed the animals. Each new row of animals that appears will require more treats for you to feed. But don't worry, you get an extra treat each round. Also keep in mind there is level progression in the game. For example, when you save 35 pets, you advance to level 2, where each round two new roads of pets will spawn. You'll recieve an indicator in the bottom right corner, where your pet will notify you of the level up.</p>
                    <p><b>Instructions for the game:</b></p>
                    <p>Use your mouse to drag and draw a line where you want to fire your treats, release the button, when ready. The treats will bounce of the animals, once they hit the bottom, they will return and refill the treats you have to feed the animals again.</p>
                    <p><b>Warning!</b></p>
                    <p>The game is not optmised for mobile devices, so please play it on PC. <b>If you like the game and would like to play it on mobile let me know (socials are bellow).</b> </p>

                    <p><b>Version 1.0:</b></p>
                    <p>This is the first version of the game. The one I felt is polished enough to be published. There are still some features missing and a lot of room for improvment so if you like this game <b>let me know</b> and I will continue to make the game better.</p>
                    <p><b>Is the game avaliable on mobile?</b></p>
                    <p>Not yet, but with enough interest I'm, willing to put it on the mobile stores.</p>

                    <p><b>Version 2.0:</b></p>
                    <p>I have a lot of ideas on how to make the game look, feel and play better. Here are the improvments planned for the update (time of the update is not defined:)</p>
                    <p><ul>
                      <li>Sound control</li>
                      <li>Treat flying animation</li>
                      <li>Treat hitting animation</li>
                      <li>Public scoreboard</li>
                      <li>Advanced leveling system (adding barriers, variable new row spawn after a certain point, new powerups)</li>
                      <li>More pets to save! (more game worlds)</li>
                    </ul></p>
